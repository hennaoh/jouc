- **Terra Nil** is a game about restoring the ecosystem of Earth's wasteland. Love the OST, and if you're new to the game play in Gardener mode because I played Ecologist my first run and I'm stuck because I keep running out of resources.
- Finally watched **Moana 2**.

Moana's ascension to demi-godhood was deserved, unlike what some reviews I'd heard said and Simea and Pua MUST be protected.</details>
- Created a Flexoki theme for `xfce-terminal` and posted about it [here](https://paper.wf/jouc/creating-a-flexoki-theme-for-xfce-terminal).
- After *five* months at home I am back to school and already I want to go back. Thankfully it's my final year in the hellhole I study at.

### What I Read

- Read a bunch of **John Dickson Carr/Carter Dickson**. The books are easy to pick up and if you have time, you can finish one in a day. I just don't like how the women are either the murderer, the love interest of the innocent bystander protagonist, mean/nagging, or the sexy homewrecker type who may or may not be a murderer. Usually if the protagonist of the book is interested in a woman then she's definitely not the murderer ðŸ™„. Maybe it's the avuncular tone the books take with women; if she's young she has a good head on her shoulders if she's supposed to be innocent and if older she's nice or something of that nature. I can't be too judgemental since I'm reading a product of its era.
	- *The Red Widow Murders*
	- *The Man Who Could Not Shudder* (dropped this. The romantic misunderstanding was beginning to grate on me.)
