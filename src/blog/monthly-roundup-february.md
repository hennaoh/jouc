- I loved [this game](https://cxmi.itch.io/the-sea-god) about sea gods and whales. It's short, but the ambience and the art are just so nice and I could vividly picture being undersea. 10/10, would definitely replay.

- Listened to *Hurry Up Tomorrow*, by The Weeknd. Loved the album from top to bottom. Some of my favourites from the album:
  - *Reflections Laughing* (Florence And The Machine on a Weeknd track? Bring!)
  - *Cry For Me*
  - _Timeless_
  - _Drive_
  - _I Can't Wait To Get There_

- Got back into bodyweight exercises/calisthenics.

- Discovered [Murdle](https://murdle.com/). It's like murder mystery Sudoku but Clue-style.

- Rediscovered abacuses on TikTok and found [Simple Soroban](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.net.btco.soroban&hl=en-US). It's a Japanese abacus app but an abacus is an abacus. It's also lightweight and has tutorials, which is my favourite thing about it.

- Played **Papa's Mocharia To Go!** while waiting for *Good Coffee, Great Coffee*'s release.
