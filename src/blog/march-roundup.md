# Monthly Roundup: March '25

## What I Read

* _Babel_, R.F Kuang
  Did not go beyond Chapter Eight. The book was too long and kept repeating itself.

* _The Eight of Swords_, John Dickson Carr

## What I Played

* _Good Coffee, Great Coffee_: After two tries in February when it launched and earlier in the month, I was finally able to install and play it. Was it worth the wait? I'd say so.
