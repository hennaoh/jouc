<li>**shoot**, *no na*</li>
<li>**Replay**, *Cynthia Erivo*</li>
<li><details><summary>**TiFFANY**, *iDK featuring Gunna*</summary>
I especially love it because I heard it first when a marching band played this song, and their rendition was so nice I went to find the original song, and then I fell in love with the song.</details></li>
<li><details><summary>**Hold Them Down**, *Jorge Rivera-Herrans*</summary>
After many recommendations, I've finally given and listened to some of the EPIC musical songs and this song was what really got me interested in the whole thing.</details></li>
<li><details><summary>**LEGOLAS**, *ODUMODUBLVCK*</summary>
Odumodu basically rehashed DOG EAT DOG II. I don't mind though, and I'm looking forward to the album.</details></li>

## What I Did

* I finally got round to backing up my configuration files (dotfiles). SublimeMerge was helpful, although it seems slightly easier to do all the *git* things in a terminal (even though I have to sign in *every* time I want to push a commit).
* I also spent the majority of this month in school, standing in theatres and ward rounds. I'll be doing the same thing next month, but at least I won't be in the OR.
* Started learning shell scripting. TBH the only reason I'm doing this is so I can try out [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

## What I Read

* [*The Art of Gold Digging*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109544/the-art-of-gold-digging): a webnovel about a girl isekai-ed into one of those mysterious characters who show up only to say cryptic stuff that isn't very helpful. I've been looking for something that gives us a glimpse of what the readers of the novel the MC has been isekai-ed into think of the character, and finally I've found this. It's still ongoing but I hope it goes well. So far, so good.
- *Chasing Sunlight*, Inadvisably Compelled

## Other Stuff I'd Like to Share

- Theme of the month: [*Nord*](https://www.nordtheme.com/).
- I finally replaced `nano` with `micro` after much initial skepticism. *How different could they be? They're both CLI text editors*, I thought. Well, I tried micro out at last and the difference is so clear I can't believe I've been willingly using `nano` when `micro` existed all along.
    - For one, the keybindings in micro are much more intuitive. I don't have to `Ctrl+X` to save when I can just use the regular `Ctrl+S` shortcut that everyone knows.
    - Another point for micro: *it has themes*. I don't know if it's obvious yet but I like theming my stuff. I like everything to look nice, and micro seems to like that too.
- I came across a [fanzine](https://opanimalszine.itch.io/friend-shaped-a-one-piece-animals-zine) about the animals of One Piece. One of my dreams is to own a Suu plushy, so this was a lovely find in the midst of the hell I'm currently going through. They even have digital merch like wallpapers and printable stickers, which is a nice bonus. Even better, it's all completely *free*!

<div style="text-align:center;"><small>*Here, have a Suu*</small></div>

- After years of using the same launcher, I finally let go of Nova Launcher on my phone. I wanted something new, so I went looking for FOSS launchers. It ended up being [*Kvaesitso*](https://kvaesitso.mm20.de/).
    - What I love most about Kvaesitso is the search function. I could search and find files on my BlackBerry from the home screen, but Android didn't seem to have that function and I haven't found any other launchers that can do that. This is where Kvaesitso shines for me.
    - I can do calculations, set a timer, find a contactâ€”all from my search bar. The only thing I dislike about Kvaesitso is losing the folders I had on my home screen and app drawer with Nova.

## What I'm Looking Forward To

- Failbetter Games, the studio behind games such as [*Fallen London*](https://www.failbettergames.com/games/fallen-london), [*Sunless Sea*](https://www.failbettergames.com/games/sunless-sea) and [*Sunless Skies*](https://www.failbettergames.com/games/sunless-skies) (these games provide part of the lore and inspiration for *Chasing Sunlight*), are debuting a new game in June. It won't be in the Fallen London universe, unlike all their other games, but I'm still excited to see it anyway.
- There's going to be a Comic Con in my area soon. Hopefully I won't go broke buying merch.
- It'll be two months to my final board exams in June.
