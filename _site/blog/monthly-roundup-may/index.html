<li>**shoot**, *no na*</li>
<li>**Replay**, *Cynthia Erivo*</li>
<li><details><summary>**TiFFANY**, *iDK featuring Gunna*</summary>
I especially love it because I heard it first when a marching band played this song, and their rendition was so nice I went to find the original song, and then I fell in love with the song.</details></li>
<li><details><summary>**Hold Them Down**, *Jorge Rivera-Herrans*</summary>
After many recommendations, I've finally given and listened to some of the EPIC musical songs and this song was what really got me interested in the whole thing.</details></li>
<li><details><summary>**LEGOLAS**, *ODUMODUBLVCK*</summary>
Odumodu basically rehashed DOG EAT DOG II. I don't mind though, and I'm looking forward to the album.</details></li>

## What I Did
<ul>
<li>I finally got round to backing up my configuration files (dotfiles). SublimeMerge was helpful, although it seems slightly easier to do all the <em>git</em> things in a terminal (even though I have to sign in <em>every</em> time I want to push a commit).</li>
<li>I also spent the majority of this month in school, standing in theatres and ward rounds. I'll be doing the same thing next month, but at least I won't be in the OR.</li>
<li>Started learning shell scripting. TBH the only reason I'm doing this is so I can try out <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum">gum</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Read</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109544/the-art-of-gold-digging"><em>The Art of Gold Digging</em></a>: a webnovel about a girl isekai-ed into one of those mysterious characters who show up only to say cryptic stuff that isn't very helpful. I've been looking for something that gives us a glimpse of what the readers of the novel the MC has been isekai-ed into think of the character, and finally I've found this. It's still ongoing but I hope it goes well. So far, so good.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Chasing Sunlight</em>, Inadvisably Compelled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Stuff I'd Like to Share</h2>
<ul>
<li>Theme of the month: <a href="https://www.nordtheme.com/"><em>Nord</em></a>.</li>
<li>I finally replaced <code>nano</code> with <code>micro</code> after much initial skepticism. <em>How different could they be? They're both CLI text editors</em>, I thought. Well, I tried micro out at last and the difference is so clear I can't believe I've been willingly using <code>nano</code> when <code>micro</code> existed all along.
<ul>
<li>For one, the keybindings in micro are much more intuitive. I don't have to <code>Ctrl+X</code> to save when I can just use the regular <code>Ctrl+S</code> shortcut that everyone knows.</li>
<li>Another point for micro: <em>it has themes</em>. I don't know if it's obvious yet but I like theming my stuff. I like everything to look nice, and micro seems to like that too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I came across a <a href="https://opanimalszine.itch.io/friend-shaped-a-one-piece-animals-zine">fanzine</a> about the animals of One Piece. One of my dreams is to own a Suu plushy, so this was a lovely find in the midst of the hell I'm currently going through. They even have digital merch like wallpapers and printable stickers, which is a nice bonus. Even better, it's all completely <em>free</em>!</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:center;"><small>*Here, have a Suu*</small></div>
<ul>
<li>After years of using the same launcher, I finally let go of Nova Launcher on my phone. I wanted something new, so I went looking for FOSS launchers. It ended up being <a href="https://kvaesitso.mm20.de/"><em>Kvaesitso</em></a>.
<ul>
<li>What I love most about Kvaesitso is the search function. I could search and find files on my BlackBerry from the home screen, but Android didn't seem to have that function and I haven't found any other launchers that can do that. This is where Kvaesitso shines for me.</li>
<li>I can do calculations, set a timer, find a contactâ€”all from my search bar. The only thing I dislike about Kvaesitso is losing the folders I had on my home screen and app drawer with Nova.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I'm Looking Forward To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Failbetter Games, the studio behind games such as <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/games/fallen-london"><em>Fallen London</em></a>, <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/games/sunless-sea"><em>Sunless Sea</em></a> and <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/games/sunless-skies"><em>Sunless Skies</em></a> (these games provide part of the lore and inspiration for <em>Chasing Sunlight</em>), are debuting a new game in June. It won't be in the Fallen London universe, unlike all their other games, but I'm still excited to see it anyway.</li>
<li>There's going to be a Comic Con in my area soon. Hopefully I won't go broke buying merch.</li>
<li>It'll be two months to my final board exams in June.</li>
</ul>
