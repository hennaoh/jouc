<ul>
<li><strong>Terra Nil</strong> is a game about restoring the ecosystem of Earth's wasteland. Love the OST, and if you're new to the game play in Gardener mode because I played Ecologist my first run and I'm stuck because I keep running out of resources.</li>
<li>Finally watched <strong>Moana 2</strong>.</li>
</ul>

Moana's ascension to demi-godhood was deserved, unlike what some reviews I'd heard said and Simea and Pua MUST be protected.</details>
- Created a Flexoki theme for `xfce-terminal` and posted about it [here](https://paper.wf/jouc/creating-a-flexoki-theme-for-xfce-terminal).
- After *five* months at home I am back to school and already I want to go back. Thankfully it's my final year in the hellhole I study at.
<h3>What I Read</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read a bunch of <strong>John Dickson Carr/Carter Dickson</strong>. The books are easy to pick up and if you have time, you can finish one in a day. I just don't like how the women are either the murderer, the love interest of the innocent bystander protagonist, mean/nagging, or the sexy homewrecker type who may or may not be a murderer. Usually if the protagonist of the book is interested in a woman then she's definitely not the murderer ðŸ™„. Maybe it's the avuncular tone the books take with women; if she's young she has a good head on her shoulders if she's supposed to be innocent and if older she's nice or something of that nature. I can't be too judgemental since I'm reading a product of its era.
<ul>
<li><em>The Red Widow Murders</em></li>
<li><em>The Man Who Could Not Shudder</em> (dropped this. The romantic misunderstanding was beginning to grate on me.)</li>
</ul>
