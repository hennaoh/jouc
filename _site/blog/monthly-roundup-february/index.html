<li>I loved <a href="https://cxmi.itch.io/the-sea-god">this game</a> about sea gods and whales. It's short, but the ambience and the art are just so nice and I could vividly picture being undersea. 10/10, would definitely replay.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Listened to <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em>, by The Weeknd. Loved the album from top to bottom. Some of my favourites from the album:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reflections Laughing</em> (Florence And The Machine on a Weeknd track? Bring!)</li>
<li><em>Cry For Me</em></li>
<li><em>Timeless</em></li>
<li><em>Drive</em></li>
<li><em>I Can't Wait To Get There</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got back into bodyweight exercises/calisthenics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovered <a href="https://murdle.com/">Murdle</a>. It's like murder mystery Sudoku but Clue-style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rediscovered abacuses on TikTok and found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.net.btco.soroban&amp;hl=en-US">Simple Soroban</a>. It's a Japanese abacus app but an abacus is an abacus. It's also lightweight and has tutorials, which is my favourite thing about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Played <strong>Papa's Mocharia To Go!</strong> while waiting for <em>Good Coffee, Great Coffee</em>'s release.</p>
</li>
