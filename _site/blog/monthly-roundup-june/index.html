<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://moralanxietystudio.com/">Roadwarden</a></em> is a text-based RPG about the titular 'Roadwarden' whose duty is to explore the unexplored peninsula in a number of days. It was a pleasant surprise how it sucked me in because the first time I tried it I gave up as I wasn't in the mood for something so text- and story-heavy, but the second time I finished it in two days. Will definitely replay, and it's a <strong>10/10</strong> for me.</details></li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Read</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.beam-shop.de/media/image/34/2f/a6/9781912408535.jpg" alt="Book cover of Everything Good Will Come"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Everything Good Will Come</em>, Sefi Atta
<ul>
<li>I have a lot of thoughts about this, but it's a <strong>3/5</strong> for me. It was nice, but it didn't change my life or anything.</li>
<li>One of my favourite things about this book was the recognition of the secondary school I attended in the school Enitan went to. As it turns out, the author is also an Old Girl of my alma mater.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Stuff I'd Like to Share, and What I Did</h2>
<ul>
<li>Theme of the month: <em><a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin Latte (Rosewater)</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pt.bloat.cat/_/proxy?url=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/a5/78/53a5786a5dcba0cb8613b7d1555853c5.jpg" alt="EPIC the Musical Fan art"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've finally finished the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPIC:_The_Musical">EPIC: The Musical</a> saga.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lynn Diavol on YouTube made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K-eMKjo1bs">compilation</a> of the fan-made and official animatics of each song, and it's much easier to follow along when you can see what's going on. It got me wanting to read <em>The Odyssey</em>, which the musical is based on, although I can't root for Odysseus. He suffers from the typical protagonist disease in which everyone else has to die or suffer somehow for him to grow and achieve his goals (I'd be pissed if I was one of the <strong>six hundred</strong> men who died just so Odysseus could go home and kiss his wife ðŸ™„).</li>
<li>My favourite songs:
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/bWIgy-Ls-SU?si=3iw4N3Nh9gJbcAr4">The Horse and the Infant</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/hNdvp9Qo8PA?si=NsVChq55IUcXZ_io">Just A Man</a></em> and all the callbacks to this song in later songs in the saga</li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/x3KOt-3T73c?si=eGrl3AL8kdaxR81J">Full Speed Ahead</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/-oMZw8DQbaI?si=X4r-mGao8HOcVpBo">Open Arms</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/nDQyFHmuQls?si=R7T1WGO43XoeWwlr">Polyphemus</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/rND9-qeA7Lo?si=D20O8FESkDvzq6_e">Survive</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQHl2fVJ-s">Luck Runs Out</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/x_xJEfDB7y0?si=5dMK1092OdPpBplk">Mutiny</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cAId1J7msWI">Thunder Bringer</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/-u_-wpcpY-0?si=gDUO4IfbbVS-HW4m">Suffering</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://youtu.be/oeDDZNKHOVo?si=3u9TX_afoOaMLOgB">Hold Them Down</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5m3Xe7iDivk">God Games</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We know twenty years passed from the end of the Trojan War to Odysseus' return to Ithaca, but we don't really see it in the musical, except towards the end. Everything happens so fast that it looks like it happens in succession, instead of being spaced out over time.</li>
<li>I guess Odysseus should be admired for the love he has for his wife. I've never heard the word <em>Penelope</em> as much as I have this entire saga (even though he <em>does</em> cheat on his wife with Circe in <em>The Odyssey</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found out I don't have to stick to the default WriteFreely fonts in my blog's CSS. I don't know if there's been an update somewhere, or I was the one who didn't realise it, but I'm going to change some things when I can...and I have! Enjoy the new-ish look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An update from <a href="https://paper.wf/jouc/monthly-roundup-may-2025">last month</a>: Failbetter Games' new game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">Mandrake</a>, and it's a <em>farming game</em>. I'm done with the farming genre of games, especially if they resemble much-hyped (and maybe overhyped Stardew Valley), but we'll see when it comes out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://www.webnovel.com/book/lord-of-mysteries_11022733006234505">Lord of the Mysteries</a></em> announced an anime adaptation last year, and it finally began airing in June. This is your chance to read the web novel before the entire thing comes out, so you're not too confused. I'm just sad I can't get into it right now because of my exams. At least I know what I'll be doing after exams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another update: I had to miss the Comic Con. I'm not too bothered about this, since it turned out to be more of an event for gamers, but I <em>did</em> spend money on the ticket and that's what hurts me the most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninstalled TikTok, and I'm already having withdrawal symptoms. We really do have phone addiction issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bloat.cat">bloat.cat</a> is a list of alternative front-ends for sites like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit e.t.c. My favourite is the Pinterest frontend, <a href="https://pt.bloat.cat">Painterest</a>. It's basically a search engine for Pinterest, but it's faster than having to log in to Pinterest and scroll through numerous ads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally figured out a way to add comments to WriteFreely. I'll write about that process in a future post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I'm Looking Forward To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian.md's</a> <a href="https://obsidianjourney.com/posts/introducing-bases-obsidian-just-got-a-built-in-database-sort-of/">Bases</a> feature seems to be the Notion-like database feature we've been looking for. Can't wait!</li>
