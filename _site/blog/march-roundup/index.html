<h1>Monthly Roundup: March '25</h1>
<h2>What I Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Babel</em>, R.F Kuang
Did not go beyond Chapter Eight. The book was too long and kept repeating itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Eight of Swords</em>, John Dickson Carr</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Played</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Good Coffee, Great Coffee</em>: After two tries in February when it launched and earlier in the month, I was finally able to install and play it. Was it worth the wait? I'd say so.</li>
</ul>
