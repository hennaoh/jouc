<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>I woke up this morning and thought about how nice the Flexoki theme was (not exactly but I don't remember exactly what I was thinking). There are Flexoki themes for other terminal emulators, but not for xfce-terminal. Why? Anyway I decided to create one for my personal use and this is my documentation of the process.</p>
<p>I used the Flexoki documentation as a reference for the colours I used (it's a very easy to use reference) and the Catppuccin and Rosepine colour schemes to structure the theme. It was easier then I expected, and slightly underwhelming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
This is not a manual for creating a theme for the xfce-terminal. I only copied and pasted from existing themes and filled in the blanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> The theme for this blog is also Flexoki-inspired.</p>

<h3>Flexoki Dark</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stephango.com">Kepano</a>, creator of the <a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki">Flexoki colour scheme</a> advises that the 400 versions of the colours should be used for dark UIs. I didn't like how dark it was, especially since I like having my xfce-terminal transparent and I had to increase the opacity to actually see anything</li>
<li>So I used the 300 variants instead, going a step lighter and I loved it!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flexoki Light</h3>
<ul>
<li>This was easier than the dark version, since all I had to do was reverse the colours</li>
<li>I don't see myself ever using this but it's always nice to have a light version in case I ever want to share it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Theme</h2>
<p><s>Eventually I'll upload the themes to Github, but for now anyone who wants can have the code</s> You can download the theme files <a href="https://github.com/hennaoh/flexoki-for-xfce-terminal">here</a>. Copy and paste the copied code into a text editor and save the theme as 'flexoki-dark/light**.theme**'.
You can use it by placing the <code>.theme</code> file into <code>~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes</code>. If the <code>colorschemes</code> directory isn't already there, create it and put the file in there. To apply: <em>Edit</em> -&gt; <em>Preferences</em> -&gt; <em>Colours</em> -&gt; <em>Presets</em> -&gt; <em>Select Preset</em>.</p>
