<h1>Monthly Roundup: March 2025</h1>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><em>Babel</em>, R.F Kuang. Did not go beyond Chapter Eight. The book was too long and kept repeating itself.</li>
<li><em>The Eight of Swords</em>, John Dickson Carr</li>
<li><em>Before I Let Go</em>, Kennedy Ryan
<ul>
<li>The author deals well with themes of grief and mental health in the Black community. My only complaint is the amount of time the female and male leads spent jumping on each other and why the author couldn't just keep the smut at one page or less.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Good Coffee, Great Coffee</em>: After two tries in February when it launched and earlier in the month, I was finally able to install and play it. Was it worth the wait? I'd say so.</li>
<li><em>Gulder Ultimate Search 12</em>. Still haven't finished, but I'm halfway though and it's great.</li>
</ul>
