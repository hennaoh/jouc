<h1>It Cannot Always Be Night</h1>
<p>You've probably heard of the title of this post, and if you haven't, does the sentence below ring a bell?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if you are not ready for day,
it cannot always be night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No? It's an excerpt from a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks, titled <em><a href="https://poetrysociety.org/poetry-in-motion/speech-to-the-young-speech-to-the-progress-toward-among-them-nora-and-henry-iii">Speech to the Young: Speech to the Progress-Toward (Among them Nora and Henry III)</a></em>. It's a poem advising young people to move for change in spite of what the doddering old people set in their ways think, but it means something different to me.</p>

<h2>Dealing With the Discomfort of Change</h2>
<p>I am not the most flexible person. I like things to be just as they are sometimes, and deviations from a routine may upset me or throw me off entirely. My first response to anything that may cause discomfort or pain is to flee. Fight or flight? Always flight.</p>
<p>What happens, then, when I cannot run?</p>
<p>I have learnt that I cannot always run from my problems. It is also not always the best option to run from an issue instead of facing it headon, no matter how painful or uncomfortable the situation may be.</p>
